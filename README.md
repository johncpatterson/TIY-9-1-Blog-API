# TIY-8-3-Node Shop Mongo


The Iron Yard week 8, day 3 assignment. This assignment added onto the first one this week by using [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com/) as the data store instead of a local array.  [Mongoose] (http://mongoosejs.com/) was used as well to make working with MongoDB easier.  I used [mLab] (https://mlab.com/) for the MongoDB hosting.
